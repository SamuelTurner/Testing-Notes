# Test Strategy

A test strategy is a broad, overall plan for achieving the test team's mission. It forms the basis for deciding which testing techniques and tools will be used, taking into account resources, the knowledge/skill of the team, the details of the project environment and the major risks present in the project.

It is impossible to run all of the tests that could exist within a given project, as there are always far too many. The test strategy helps the testers decide which tests are most worthwhile.
