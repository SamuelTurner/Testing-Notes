# Unit Testing

## What is a unit?

A unit is anything that you think of as one thing, whether it is a single line, a function or an API call. If you can think of it as a singular thing and test it in isolation as a singular thing, then it's a unit.

## What is Unit Testing?

Unit Testing is verifying that individual units of code (usually functions/methods) work as intended. It usually takes the form of glass box testing, but can sometimes be black box testing, and occurs at the implementation level, i.e: it is concerned with how a program was built, not whether it fulfils the needs of the stakeholder. When a programmer consumes an API when writing their program, they usually check the calls individually to see if they function as expected. Unit tests are often thought of as only automated tests that are run as part of regression testing, but this is not the case.
