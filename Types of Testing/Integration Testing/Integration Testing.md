# Integration Testing

## What is Integration Testing?

Integration testing involves testing two or more components/units together, in order to learn about their interactions. Integration testing can take the form of black box, glass box or translucent box testing, and occurs at the implementation level, i.e: it is concerned with how a program was built, not whether it fulfils the needs of the stakeholder.

## What are low-level and high-level Integration Testing?

Low-level integration testing is generally concerned with the interactions between two or three units, whereas high-level is concerned with multiple units or in some cases, the full system.
