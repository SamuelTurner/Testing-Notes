# Black Box Testing

## What is BBT?

Black Box Testing (BBT) is testing software without any knowledge of the code, or without using any knowledge you may already possess. You treat it as a sealed box, giving it inputs and monitoring the outputs to see what happens.

From BBT we can learn simply what it does, and from this we can judge whether it does what it should do, and doesn't do what it shouldn't do. In order to understand what it should do, we need to study the needs and expectations of the people who will use it.
