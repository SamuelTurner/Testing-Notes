# Acceptance Testing

## What is Acceptance Testing?

Acceptance Testing is testing a software product to determine whether it meets the client's requirements or not. It became popular during the early days of software development, when most software was developed under contract.

## Contract based Acceptance Testing

Traditionally, the contractor and customer would negociate a contract, the contractor would then go away and build the product before judging it to be "done". The customer would then perform (or get a third party to perform) acceptance testing on the product to determine whether the customer should accept and pay for the product, or not.

## "Acceptance Testing" Without a Contract

Software is often now developed in house, so there isn't a customer to accept the product. Regardless, Acceptance Testing is now commonly used as a synonym for system testing, or merely checking whether the product is ready to be released. When used this way, it is the decision of the development team, not the customer, that is described.
