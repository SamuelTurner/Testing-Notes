# Mission statement

Cem Kaner:

> On every project it is useful for the test team to explicitly define it's mission. A mission statement is a brief, focussed description of a group's or project's core objectives.

## Mission

The mission of the test team within a project is generally to achieve the information objectives, which are defined by analysing the information needs of the stakeholders. Being fully aware of the mission helps the testers within the team understand which tasks are higher priority than others, as some will contribute more to the success of the mission than others. For example, hunting for bugs in the product is always worth doing in any project, but if the team's mission is to assess the progress of the project, then bug-hunting might be a low-priority task at this time.

As projects evolve the mission of the test team often changes, so the mission should be redefined as the project progresses.

## Mission Statement

The mission statement is a clear explanation of the mission. It not only allows the test team to be aware of the mission, but it can also help the stakeholders understand what the test team is going to do and not do.
