# Stakeholders

See general testing definitions for a definition on stakeholders.

##  Information needs

One of the key roles a stakeholder performs is to make decisions about the project's direction. To do this they will require information about the product, but the information they require will differ depending on who they are and what they are trying to understand. Cem Kaner gives a good example:

> Stakeholders don't all have the same information needs, they differ across projects too and across people in the same project. For example, the sales people might ask you on one project to develop a pre-release demo script for a product. This isn't about looking for bugs, everybody knows the product doesn't fully work yet, but the sales people need safe scenarios, scenarios that avoid the bugs whilst showing what the product will be able to do when it's done. They come to you [the testers] because you understand the bugs, and you probably have a better insight into how to work around them.

## Information objectives

Testers must form their information objectives based upon the information needs of the stakeholder. If the stakeholder wants to assess whether a product is stable enough to release, the tester will probably have to go bug-hunting, whereas if the stakeholder was concerned with the progress of the development of the product, then the tester would refer to the project specification to get an overview of the status of the product.
