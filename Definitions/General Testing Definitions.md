# General Testing Definitions

There are no totally correct definitions of words in any language, as they're really just noises or shapes that mean something to us, so they're always subjective. These are some definitions I've collected that I consider to be reasonable.

## Software Testing

Software Testing is an investigation into the quality/status of a software product. The aim is to provide information about the product to an interested party (e.g: stakeholders). Usually the investigation takes the form of a series of experiments, designed to answer a question.

James Bach:

> Testing is questioning a product in order to evaluate it.

Cem Kaner:

> Testing is an empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.

## Computer Program/Software

A program exists to serve a purpose, whether you think of it as solving a problem or providing a service to someone. Cem Kaner said:

> ...textbooks usually have this crazy definition, "A program is a set of instructions for a computer", defining a program that way is like defining a house as a set of construction materials that you put together according to a house design pattern. Yeh, you can define a house that way, but it misses the point of the house! A house is built for people to live in.

A program is really a communication between people, containing insctructions that can be executed by a computer but usually organised, commented or documented to aid readability.

## Quality

Jerry Weinberg:

> Quality is value to some person

Quality is subjective; different users or stakeholders will value a change more than others.

## Bug

James Bach:

> Any threat to the value of the product to any stakeholder who matters.

Anything that reduces the quality of the product is a bug, but quality is subjective meaning that bugs are too. Bugs have been known to be left in software as they sometimes add quality, especially in computer games where they can sometimes add entertainment value.

## Implementation Level & System Level Testing

Most types of testing fit into one of two categories, Implementation Level and System Level Testing. Implementation level testing tests whether the program works as the program intended, and System Level Testing tests whether the program meets the needs of the stakeholder.
