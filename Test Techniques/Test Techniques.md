# Test Techniques

Test techniques are often compared to recipes. You take some ingrediants, put them together, and get something tasty at the end.

The following is a list of activities lifted from Cem Kaner's Black Box Software Testing course slides. Most test techniques instruct you to do several of these, but rearely all:

* Analyse the situation
* Model the test space
* Select what to cover
* Determine test oracles
* Configure the test system
* Operate the test system
* Observe the test system
* Evaluate the test results
